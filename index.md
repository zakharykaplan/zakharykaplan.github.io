## About Me

After completing my second year in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, I now work as a software developer for [Geomechanica Inc](https://www.geomechanica.com).

## My Interests

My passion is systems programming, but I sometimes dabble in embedded development (@arduino).
I'm fascinated by the incredible things you can do with computers, and strive to understand as much about it as possible.

## What I've Done

In the past, I've focused my attention towards machine learning, and just recently co-authored a paper accepted into the 2020 IEEE INFOCOM conference!
