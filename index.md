## About Me

I'm a third year Computer Engineering student studying at the University of Toronto.
In my spare time, I like to tinker with whatever technology I can get my hands on.
I'm fascinated by the incredible things one can do with computers; I strive to understand and explore technology as much as possible.

## What I've Done

### Projects

Feel free to explore [my GitHub](https://github.com/zakharykaplan) to see some of my projects. They're definitely worth checking out!

### Work

In my second year of undergraduate studies, I was a member of the [iQua Research Group](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu) and worked on several machine learning related projects, the findings of one of which were published in a paper accepted into 2020 IEEE INFOCOM.

More recently, this past summer, I worked as a software developer for [Geomechanica Inc](https://www.geomechanica.com), during which time I had the opportunity to solve complex problems developing features for Irazu, their geomechanical simulation software.
